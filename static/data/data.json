The 90% decline in numbers of mature individuals over the past 30 years is due primarily to collection of plants by enthusiasts, and as the only known population is very small, even low rates of off-take will&#160;have had significant impacts on population size. It is suspected that the species could go extinct in the wild within the next 30 years (three generations). It is feasible that other, undetected subpopulations exist in north Sumatra, but despite extensive searches of apparently suitable habitats around Lake Toba, this species has yet to be found elsewhere. For this reason, it is important to survey other areas of potentially suitable habitat in North Sumatra to try to find other populations of this species, as other conservation measures may not be effective in time to save the remaining plants at the type locality.",

Correspondingly, the species has disappeared from nearly its entire geographical range, being restricted to one remnant subpopulation. The remaining confirmed subpopulation is currently under threat from local dredging for gold at its nesting site, and possibly from the entire region being flooded by a planned reservoir.",

        "Description": "Although the Saiga currently does not meet the Red List Criteria thresholds for Critically Endangered, the previous assessment of CR A2acd is retained in this assessment because this reassessment falls under the IUCN’s five year rule. This rule applies to taxa that appear to be genuinely improving in status, and states that “a taxon may be moved from a category of higher threat to a category of lower threat if and when none of the criteria of the higher category has been met for five years or more”. The Saiga is considered to have crossed the thresholds between CR and EN around 2015, therefore its status will be re-evaluated again in 2020. Saiga currently meets the thresholds for Endangered under criterion A4 based on observed, estimated and projected declines of >50% over 11 years (three generations), commencing from May 2015, due to the risk of mass mortality events (MME) resulting from outbreaks of disease, exacerbated by climatic and environmental factors, and taking place alongside ongoing poaching pressure for the illegal trade in horns. Saiga populations are inherently vulnerable to mass mortality from a range of diseases. Since 2010, four disease outbreaks have caused large-scale mortality in Saiga. The most severe resulted in the death of over 200,000 Saiga in the course of three weeks in May 2015. The cause of this outbreak (and suspected in the earlier two) has been shown to be haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, which is endemic in Saiga. Lethal levels of infection are believed to have been triggered by environmental conditions including abnormally high humidity and temperature. Warm and wet climatic conditions are expected to increase in frequency due to effects of recorded and predicted climate change. The most recent MME occurred in the Mongolian population in early 2017, caused by PPR, and killed an estimated 54% of the population. Saiga are also subject to strong commercial hunting pressure and the survival of viable populations is entirely dependent on stringent implementation of conservation measures.",

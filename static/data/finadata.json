This is because of associated variation in frequency of elevation, salinity and wave action (Duke et al. 1998). With rise in sea-level, the habitat requirements of each species will be disrupted, and species zones will suffer mortality at their present locations and re-establish at higher elevations in areas that were previously landward zones (Ellison 2005). If sea-level rise is a continued trend over this century, then there will be continued mortality and re-establishment of species zones. However, species that are easily dispersed and fast growing/fast producing will cope better than those which are slower growing and slower to reproduce. In addition, mangrove area is declining globally due to a number of localized threats. The main threat is habitat destruction and removal of mangrove areas. Reasons for removal include cleared for shrimp farms, agriculture, fish ponds, rice production and salt pans, and for the development of urban and industrial areas, road construction, coconut plantations, ports, airports, and tourist resorts. Other threats include pollution from sewage effluents, solid wastes, siltation, oil, and agricultural and urban runoff.

        "threat": "The major threats to Wild Water Buffalo are loss of genetic diversity due to introgression with domestic and feral buffaloes, as well as threats from hunting, and disease from domestic livestock.   Genetic Factors  It is highly likely that the existence of Wild Water Buffalo is being threatened by genetic introgression from domestic buffaloes in Nepal (Flamand et al. 2003). In India, hybridisation is thought to be evident in the North-east where wild buffaloes are known to hybridise with Khunti (cattle camp) buffaloes which were grazed within the park prior to their eviction (Muley 2001). However, it was suggested that there is a genetic differentiation between wild and domestic/feral buffaloes in Kaziranga National Park, and that the Wild Water Buffalo is comparable to Wild Water Buffalo in central India (CCMB 2010). Although, the central Indian buffaloes do live along with hybrid and feral buffaloes, so introgression could have occurred to some degree in both locations. Introgression is likely to take place throughout the range wherever wild and domestic buffalo come into contact. It is estimated that more than 90% of the population exists in the vicinity of considerable populations of Domestic Water Buffalo (See Table 1. in the Supporting Information: B. arnee additional information populations in vicinity of Domestic Water Buffalo). This means there is a the risk of hybridisation is high. As the wild populations shrink  and become fragmented the risk of hybridisation increases exponentially (within a few generations). Given the fragmented nature of the populations and the proximity of Domestic Water Buffalo, and applying the precautionary principle, the truly pure Wild Water Buffalo population could half of the current estimated population, or less.   In evolutionary terms wild and domesticated water buffaloes are closely related, being separated by perhaps as little as 5,000 years (Cockrill 1974, S. Hedges in prep). The phylogeny of buffaloes has not been fully resolved and it is unclear as to the number of domestication events that have occurred in the case of this species. At least two separate domestications, one for ‘swamp’ and one for ‘river’ type buffalo are thought to have taken place (Lau et al. 1998, Kumar et al. 2007, Yindee et al. 2010, Babar et al. 2012) Additionally, the practise in some villages, of allowing wild buffalo to sire calves with domestics (Flamand et al. 2003) may have resulted in continued gene flow between the two, at least in one direction. The situation is analogous to other species which are the progenitors of domesticated forms especially that of the wild cat Felis (Beaumont et al. 2001. This may be particularly the case in Indochina where traditional methods of Domestic Water Buffalo husbandry allowed animals to wander freely for the majority of the year, often in natural habitat over 5 km from villages; indeed, it is often difficult to determine whether animals in forest areas are domesticated or truly feral; as such before hunting largely eliminated the Wild Water Buffalo population there must have been much contact between the two species, and presumably a great deal of opportunity for introgression, albeit perhaps strongly in one direction, given the male-dominated mating system of water buffalo (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J Timmins in litt. 2013). Domestic Water Buffalo in ‘frontier’ rural areas of Indochina often show a strong similarity to published and other widely available images of Thai and Indian Wild Water Buffaloes (R. J Timmins in litt. 2013), while Clark (undated) wrote that neither local people nor experienced hunters could distinguish Wild and Domestic Water Buffaloes on the basis of physical appearance, on the Lagna (La Ngà) River alluvial plains of southern Vietnam where the two occurred together, and that they were only identifiable on the basis of their behaviour: further evidence that the genepools of Indochinese Domestic Water Buffalo and Wild Water Buffalo are probably very close.   Whilst it is likely that the genetic integrity of Wild Water Buffalo is threatened by introgression from the domestic form, the risk of inbreeding within the dwindling populations of Wild Buffalo must not be underestimated as a threat to its survival. Small populations are at risk of inbreeding depression (i.e. lowered reproductive fitness) which can in turn lead to further population decline (Hendrick and Kalinowski 2000). The small population size of Wild Water Buffalo in central India (34–42 individuals), means that there is a high risk of extinction through demographic factors (WTI 2010). For example, stochastic variation in demographic rates causes small populations to fluctuate randomly in size. Wild Water Buffalo in some populations may face the risk of inbreeding effects through low population numbers. Whilst introgression with domestic forms may paradoxically have the ability to mitigate some of the inbreeding risk by injecting genetic diversity, it carries with it the risk of erosion of the genetic diversity unique to the wild form (as mentioned above).   A challenge to the captive breeding of wild buffalo will be balancing the relative risks of inbreeding and out breeding when choosing candidate animals for a breeding programme. This is likely to require a detailed level of genetic screening, the technical challenges of which must not be underestimated (Randi et al. 2008). Since introgressed buffaloes may outnumber non-introgressed Wild Buffaloes considerably, it may be necessary to view introgressed animals as a vital genetic resource from which wild genetic diversity can be recaptured through controlled backcrossing, as opposed to viewing them as animals tainted by domestic introgression.   Hunting  Wild Buffaloes have for long been hunted ritually, owing to their formidable nature and horns. Besides sport hunting that was prolific until the 1960s, hunting for meat is also a popular practice in several parts of North-east India as well as in many South-east Asian countries. With legal protection of Wild Water Buffalo in India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Thailand (Hedges et al. 2008), the severity of hunting may have reduced over the recent past. Although poaching for wild meat is still a real threat to any remaining Wild Water Buffalo populations in South-east Asia, especially Cambodia and Myanmar, trophy hunting may be the most worrying threat, especially if general knowledge of the existence of remnant populations grows, as the economic growth in the region has seen massive growth in exploitation of valuable natural resources, such as wildlife-derived status symbols (R.J. Timmins in litt. 2013).   However, Paradh, traditional community hunting, still persists in some part of central India (Mishra 2000). Also, extensive droughts and habitat fragmentation and degradation have caused Wild Water Buffaloes habitually to invade and raid crops, leading to repercussions by local villagers. This perhaps single-handedly has led to a severe population decline in many states such as in Chhattisgarh.   Disease  One of the persistent threats to wildlife is the threat of disease outbreaks from livestock raised in the surrounding villages. For instance, several sub-populations of  another large bovid, the Gaur (Bos gaurus), in peninsular India, were known to have been almost exterminated through a severe outbreak of Rinderpest in 1968 (Krishnan 1972). Similarly, Wild Water Buffaloes are also susceptible to a number of cattle diseases, and therefore, where very small populations remain, they face the risks of extinction due to disease.   Habitat Loss and Degradation:   Wild Buffaloes like most other large herbivores, require large spaces with adequate food and water supply to survive which is negatively impacted by fragmentation and degradation of forest and grassland areas. Although most cattle camps have been removed from within Kaziranga in Assam, extensive livestock grazing in Chhattisgarh may place the Wild Water Buffaloes there in situations of severe resource competition. This is because of pasture depletion and lack of water resources, which could lead to direct conflict.   Local community and insurgency  There are areas in central India where Wild Water Buffalo exists and there are difficulties of insurgency and law and order problems. The result is that in such areas, conservation is often difficult to achieve without the support of local people.   Probably one of the most significant constraints, is an under appreciation even amongst conservation organisations of the importance, significance and plight of Wild Water Buffalo populations (Choudhury 2010). This is exemplified by the situation in Cambodia where next-to-no species-specific action has been taken for Wild Water Buffalo, despite the known presence of a remnant population in one area, with to date the fear that the population may have declined and possibly even been lost (R. J. Timmins in litt. 2013).",

        "Description": "Although the Saiga currently does not meet the Red List Criteria thresholds for Critically Endangered, the previous assessment of CR A2acd is retained in this assessment because this reassessment falls under the IUCN’s five year rule. This rule applies to taxa that appear to be genuinely improving in status, and states that “a taxon may be moved from a category of higher threat to a category of lower threat if and when none of the criteria of the higher category has been met for five years or more”. The Saiga is considered to have crossed the thresholds between CR and EN around 2015, therefore its status will be re-evaluated again in 2020. Saiga currently meets the thresholds for Endangered under criterion A4 based on observed, estimated and projected declines of >50% over 11 years (three generations), commencing from May 2015, due to the risk of mass mortality events (MME) resulting from outbreaks of disease, exacerbated by climatic and environmental factors, and taking place alongside ongoing poaching pressure for the illegal trade in horns. Saiga populations are inherently vulnerable to mass mortality from a range of diseases. Since 2010, four disease outbreaks have caused large-scale mortality in Saiga. The most severe resulted in the death of over 200,000 Saiga in the course of three weeks in May 2015. The cause of this outbreak (and suspected in the earlier two) has been shown to be haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, which is endemic in Saiga. Lethal levels of infection are believed to have been triggered by environmental conditions including abnormally high humidity and temperature. Warm and wet climatic conditions are expected to increase in frequency due to effects of recorded and predicted climate change. The most recent MME occurred in the Mongolian population in early 2017, caused by PPR, and killed an estimated 54% of the population. Saiga are also subject to strong commercial hunting pressure and the survival of viable populations is entirely dependent on stringent implementation of conservation measures.",

        "threat": "Uncontrolled illegal hunting for horns and meat since the break-up of the former USSR has led to the catastrophic fall in Saiga numbers. Selective hunting of young males and subsequent distortion of the sex ratio has also affected reproduction by heavily skewing the sex ratio (Milner-Gulland et al. 2003). A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. Extreme climatic events, pose a threat, drought in summer and severe winters, especially heavy snow or ‘dzuud’ or ‘dzut’ conditions when an ice-crust forms on top of snow and impedes access to forage. Several resulting instances of mass-mortality are known, such as the winter of 1953/54 in Kazakhstan when 80,000 animals died (Heptner et al. 1961).Saiga are susceptible to several diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and others, which may also cause large numbers of deaths. There have been four recent mass-mortality events (MME). In 2010, around two-thirds of a calving aggregation of 20,000 in the Ural population died of a peracute respiratory disease with bloat, and this was followed in 2011 by a smaller die-off of several hundreds of Saiga with similar clinical signs, immediately after calving, and grazing in the exact same location as the earlier MME, suggesting a site-specific cause. Pasteurellosis was implicated based on clinical signs and bacteriology, but very little pathology was undertaken (Kock et al. 2018).In 2015, more than 200,000 Saiga died within three weeks in central Kazakhstan. The proximate cause of death, based on multiple strands of evidence, was confirmed as haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida type B (Kock et al. 2018). Statistical modelling suggests that there was unusually high relative humidity and temperature in the days leading up to the outbreak; temperature and humidity anomalies were also observed in two previous similar events in the same region. The modelled influence of environmental covariates is consistent with known drivers of haemorrhagic septicemia. Given the Saiga population’s vulnerability to mass mortality and the likely exacerbation of climate-related and environmental stressors in the future, management of risks to population viability, such as poaching and viral livestock disease, is urgently needed, as well as robust ongoing veterinary surveillance (Kock et al. 2018).On 22nd December 2016 the first death of a Mongolian Saiga (S. t. mongolica) was reported by herders to the local authorities in Darvi Soum in the Khuisiin Gobi. Hundreds of live and dead Saiga were subsequently observed with a PPR-like syndrome and signs. Samples were confirmed at the Mongolia State Central Veterinary Laboratory (SCVL) on 6th January 2017 to contain PPR virus and gene sequencing confirmed the virus to be of high similarity to the virus recorded in sheep and goats. The Saiga infection developed rapidly into a full-blown epidemic and by the end of January; death and infection were reported across most of the Saiga range (Kock 2017). Based on carcass counts, over 54% of the population is estimated to have died.",

The construction of roads, expansion of cities and industrial activities are destroying and fragmenting tahr habitat.In northern Oman an increase in mineral mining is a growing issue which is likely to threaten and damage valuable habitats, particularly in Al Batinah and Al Buraimi.The Hajar Mountains has a large and growing domestic goat Capra hircus population, estimated at 1.8 million in 2016. Domestic goats compete directly with Arabian Tahr for limited food resources, and larger numbers of goats at a site is related to the decline and expatriation of tahr (Ross et al. 2017).  Disease transmission from domestic goats to Arabian Tahr is a potential threat. Though there is little evidence of this happening, the large overlap in their habitat preferences means it is very likely.Despite legal protection, poaching of tahr does occur, as indicated by periodic prosecutions. The overall impact of poaching on the tahr population is difficult to quantify. The lack of enforcement of anti-poaching is also an issue.Habitat fragmentation is a major issue for the species, several populations are now isolated due to development of the surrounding landscape. The Jabal Hafeet tahr population and the southeastern tahr populations are most probably isolated from northwestern tahr populations.Lack of awareness amongst local people of the status of the Arabian Tahr (as an endemic and endangered species) results in decisions being made without due consideration of the impacts on the welfare and survival of this unique and regionally important species.Groundwater supplies in the Hajar Mountains are experiencing a sharp decline (Al-Charaabi and Al-Yahyai 2013), this will negatively affect perennial water pools on which the tahr depends.We expect climate change to have a major impact on the species due to an increase in extreme and average temperatures (Alsarmi and Washington 2011), decreases in rainfall (Al-Charaabi and Al-Yahyai 2013), and the resultant changes in habitat quality and composition. As the tahr’s distribution is limited to a single mountain range, and it already occurs in the upper elevations of this range, there is little scope for adaptation to climate change by dispersal or upward movement.  As most Arabian Tahr populations are simultaneously exposed to multiple threats, cumulative impacts are a major issue. The majority of tahr populations are concurrently exposed to habitat disturbance and fragmentation, competition and disease transmission from domestic goats, poaching and the effects of climate change. ",

Naive juvenile birds are easily shot or trapped, as are adults nesting near forest edges (J. Ibanez in litt. 2008). Birds are also vulnerable to accidental capture in traps intended for wild pigs and deer, and there are several records of individuals caught in snares presumably whilst hunting on the forest floor (J. Ibanez in litt. 2008). Pesticide accumulation is another potential but unproven threat which may reduce its already slow reproductive output.

        "threat": "In South Asia, most populations are small, isolated and vulnerable to local extirpation. The key threats are the extensive loss and modification of grasslands through drainage, conversion to agriculture and plantations, overgrazing, inappropriate cutting, burning and ploughing regimes, heavy flooding, invasion of alien species, scrub expansion, dam construction and inappropriate and illegal development (Brahma and Lahkar 2009, Evans et al. 2009, van Zalinge et al. 2009, Ibbett et al. 2017). In particular, the spread of dry season rice cultivation in Cambodia is rapidly converting existing grassland habitat (Packman et al. 2014). An increase in the area of scrub vegetation between 1995/1996 and 2005 was responsible for 65% of grassland loss in Cambodia (Packman et al. 2013). Land sales and concessions are often pushed through despite resistance from local villagers (Evans et al. 2009). Excessive hunting for sport and food may have triggered the species's decline, but owing to advocacy and law enforcement this is no longer a serious threat, at least in Cambodia. Other threats may include human disturbance and trampling of nests by livestock. Detailed research into the species's ecology in Cambodia demonstrated that the effects of human disturbance are weak and annual burning is important for maintaining suitable habitat, supporting the idea that community-based grassland management that maintains traditional agricultural practices will benefit the species. This has implications for management in South Asia, where remaining (and declining) populations are largely confined to strictly protected areas in which such practices may not be occurring (Gray et al. 2007). Further study has revealed that, whilst burned grassland is selected by males during the breeding season, unburned grassland and other habitats providing cover are selected by females, demonstrating the need for management that provides a variety of habitats (Gray et al. 2009b). Proposed development of powerlines in Cambodia could prove to be a significant emerging threat to the species there (Mahood et al. 2018).",

Sheldon in litt. 2007, Biricik et al. 2008, Fisher unpublished 2016). Data from 2005-2012 suggest that low adult survival, perhaps resulting from known hunting pressure along the migration routes, appears to be the most critical demographic rate (Sheldon et al. 2013).Other key factors explaining the magnitude of declines remain poorly understood, despite much recent research. On the breeding grounds, it was probably formerly threatened by the conversion of steppe to arable cultivation, plus, perhaps less likely, the reduction in grazing by large herds of native ungulates and, latterly, by the loss of the enormous herds of domestic grazing animals from state-sponsored collective farms (Eichhorn and Khrokov 2002, Watson et al. 2006). However, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, large areas of arable cultivation have been abandoned and are reverting to natural steppe habitat, herds of domestic livestock have become concentrated around villages (where their permanent presence leads to shorter swards than were created by the vast herds that grazed semi-nomadically under the Soviet system), while an increase in fires (owing to reduced control of fires) may also have contributed to an increase in suitable habitat. These factors may be behind the possible increase in numbers (at least in parts of Kazakhstan) in recent years (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Concentration of nests in heavily grazed areas in the vicinity of villages may have increased threats from human disturbance and trampling by sheep, goats and possibly other livestock (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Low egg survival due to nesting in areas of high grazer density has been suggested as one of the causes for the species' decline (Watson et al. 2006). Nest predation by Rooks Corvus frugilegus - which have expanded widely into the breeding range with the plantation of networks of shelter-belts (Belik 2005) - was previously suggested as a cause of declines, but data from central Kazakhstan indicate this is unlikely (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007).   The species may be affected by the increasingly dry climate in its  breeding and wintering range, but it is not clear if this benefits or  threatens this semi-desert species (Watson et al. 2006). Agricultural expansion and intensification, overgrazing and loss of steppe habitats all pose threats to stopover sites used by the species (Ashoori et al. 2013, Sheldon 2013, Asswad 2014). An irrigation project distributing water from the Atatürk dam to fields around Ceylanpinar may have a negative impact on the species as the habitats change (Fisher unpublished 2016).",

For 45 nesting attempts between 2004 and 2013, egg harvest accounted for 44% of nest failures (Chen et al. 2015). The value of seabird eggs more than doubled in Zhejiang between 2005 - 2007, encouraging more people to enter the egg-harvesting trade (Anon 2007a). Poaching still occurs despite patrolling (Chen et al. 2009). Egg collection causes later breeding attempts due to re-nesting. Typhoons can cause high levels of nesting failure, responsible 48% of nesting failures in studied nests between 2004 and 2013 (Chen et al. 2015). Many of the nest failures attributed to typhoons (58%) were re-nesting attempts after the first nesting attempt failed due to egg harvest, highlighting the synergistic effects that these two threats can have on the species (Chen et al. 2015). Protection of breeding sites can reduce mortality, for example in Tideun Dao, a typhoon in the 2015 breeding season only caused 5% mortality of chicks in the colony due to maintenance of vegetation and discouragement of chicks moving down to shore (Hurrell 2015), but not all breeding sites are protected in this way.Shellfish fishing near breeding grounds is deter breeding birds (Chen et al. 2009). Fishing activities, including dynamite fishing, in wintering areas in eastern Indonesia pose an additional threat (Chen 2010), however, the scope of this is unknown. Tourism interferes with seabird breeding at Matu, although landing is prohibited (Chen et al. 2009), however there is no direct evidence to show the population impact. Human activity has also been indicated in the loss of population along South Shandong coast, which has been linked to the colonisation and development of breeding islands since the 1950s (Liu et al. 2009). This has resulted in a lack of suitable breeding habitat as areas are built up with houses, wind power plants, lighthouses and other buildings.Harmful ‘red tide’ algal blooms, caused by industrial pollution in the area, cause the death of fish, reducing prey availability to breeding seabirds (Zhao et al. 2004). Invasive species also pose a threat, with Keeled Rat Snakes, Elaphe carinata, a species known to consume tern eggs, chicks and possibly adults (Chen in litt. 2016, Chen et al. 2005) having been trapped on nesting islands (Jiushan and Wuzhishan). Rats have also been recorded at breeding sites (Matsu, Jishan and Wuzhishan islands), known to consume tern eggs and possibly chicks, there has been no direct evidence of impact on Chinese Crested Tern, however rats have been found to affect mixed bird colonies in which the Chinese Crested Tern is found (Chen et al. 2005). Due to the low population size, even a very low level of predation will likely have a significant impact.Hybrids of S.bernsteini x S.bergii have been recorded and photographed at Min Jiang estuary since 2008 as well as in all 3 colonies along China coast. This may be a significant threat given very small population size (Chen Lin and He Fengli 2011).",

The proposed Lower Srepok 3 Dam is expected to cause the flooding of a large area of Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary (BirdLife International 2010), and the Xavaburi Dam in Lao PDR is expected to disrupt habitat in the Mekong River channel (Wright et al. 2012). Logging, the encroachment of plantation agriculture and settlement  through the granting of economic land concessions is a significant and widespread threat, affecting all of the four largest known populations at Western Siem Pang IBA (BirdLife International 2010), Kulen Promtep and Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuaries and the dry forest around the Mekong River channel (Wright 2012, H. Wright in litt. 2012). In September 2012, more than 40% of the individuals recorded were found in roosts that were inside economic land concessions and more than 15% were within 5 km of a concession boundary (Wright et al. 2013b).Habitat loss has been compounded by hunting of adult birds, eggs and chicks for food, and disturbance, leading to the loss of secure feeding, roosting and nesting areas (Clements et al. 2013). Hunting pressure is exacerbated by the fact that their primary habitats appear to also be a focus for people: large rivers, forest pools and grassland/field complexes with high densities of ungulates and domestic livestock. However, hunting may now be less of a threat in Cambodia following education initiatives and the confiscation of weapons (H. Wright in litt. 2008). However, poisoned baits set for hunting continue to affect some populations (Wright 2012). In addition, hunting may not be a serious threat in East Kalimantan, but fishing through poisoning and electro-fishing may negatively impact the population there (Sutrisno and Imanuddin 2002). Recent evidence suggests that forest fires in Borneo resulting from an El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event shifted the distribution of this species to unburnt stretches of rivers (Sözer and Nijman 2005). There is considerable evidence that the species is associated with large ungulates in South-East Asia, which create and maintain the short-sward grassland feeding areas that the ibises depend upon within the dry forest landscape (T. Evans pers. comm. 2006). Hence, the demise of wild ungulates within the region may have catalysed its rapid decline resulting in few remote refugia for the species (R. Timmins; T. Clements, in litt. 2007). Moreover, its dependency on herbivore-altered habitats means that remnant areas are close to people and associated with domestic livestock, making it more vulnerable to human-induced habitat modification (R. Timmins; T. Clements, in litt. 2007), and a large proportion of the population occurs outside of protected areas (Wright et al. 2012). Of 609 individuals counted in 2011-2012, more than 80% roosted outside protected areas (Wright et al. 2013b). Probably the most significant threats currently come from land concessions for logging or plantations, and infrastructure development such as dam construction, which threaten even those areas that currently have protected status (Wright et al. 2013b).

Increasing disturbance and habitat degradation from settlement, conversion to agriculture, harvesting of wetland resources and, more locally, poaching are thought to present significant threats in key protected areas (e.g. Namdapha National Park) in north-east India, Bhutan and Myanmar (W.

However, the national announcement of an end to the reclamation of intertidal land in January 2018 (Anon. 2018, Lei 2018) appears to be a dramatic shift towards alleviating new impacts from this threat. Smooth Cord-grass Spartina alterniflora is an invasive plant used to stabilise mudflats to assist in reclamation along the Chinese coast and rapidly leaves intertidal areas unsuitable for Spoon-billed Sandpipers, dramatically reducing habitat availability (Menxiu et al. 2012, Peng et al. 2017). At both Rudong and Dongling, Spartina alterniflora has formed dense stands with considerable spread noted between spring 2014 and autumn 2015 (Peng et al. 2017), and it has also been found on Leizhou mudflat (V. Fu in litt. 2017). The Rudong mudflats are also the site for development of the largest wind farm in Asia, which could prove to be another threat to this species (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Li et al. undated). Plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia and cross-dams along the coast of Bangladesh continue to pose threats (Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury et al. 2011, Zöckler 2015); however, this plan is currently on hold and plans to protect the area have been developed (Zöckler 2015).Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh and Myanmar (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009, Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler in litt. 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010b), and this may be a particularly serious threat to birds wintering on Nan Thar Island and in the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010b). A survey of hunting activities in five villages around Sonadia Island, Bangladesh, in September 2010 found that of the 53 hunters interviewed, eight of them claimed to have caught a total of 22 Spoon-billed Sandpipers between October 2009 and April 2010 (Chowdhury 2010). Hunting in the species's non-breeding range could be a crucial factor in the poor rate of recruitment into the breeding population, as immature birds do not return to the breeding areas until they are two years old and thus are more exposed to capture (Zöckler et al. 2010b). However, recent conservation action aimed at reducing trapping on the wintering grounds appears to have been successful (Clark et al. 2014) and may have reduced this significant source of mortality (D. Pain in litt. 2016). Large-scale wader trapping was observed at Fucheng, south-west Guangdong province, China, where four Spoon-billed Sandpiper were observed in December 2012 (BirdLife Asia 2013), but surveys for the species in south China in January 2017 did not find any illegal mist nets (V. Fu in litt. 2017). Monofilament fishing nets set over high tides were found to be a serious problem on the central Chinese coast, with multiple parallel lines of nets set at Tiaozini in autumn 2015 were found to have captured scores of birds after just one nocturnal high tide, including one juvenile Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Peng et al. 2017). Hunting with nets has also been reported from Viet Nam (Long 2015). Between August and October 2014, more than a thousand dead wading birds, including two Spoon-billed Sandpipers, were found on the Tiaozini Sandbanks (Zöckler et al. 2015, Peng et al. 2017). Tests are ongoing to understand the cause of mortality; however, poisoned bait was discovered in the area.There are no immediate threats to the breeding grounds, but nests in the vicinity of villages are sometimes destroyed by dogs (E. Syroechkovskiy in litt. 2007). Poor breeding productivity in recent years has been attributed to heavy nest predation and bad weather (Syroechkovskiy et al. 2009). Significant habitat degradation has been observed in 5 of 30 visited breeding locations (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010). Human disturbance, both by residents and researchers, may cause increased levels of nest desertion and predation by foxes and skuas (Zöckler and Bunting 2006). Shorebirds, including this species, are also occasionally killed by children with slingshots (Zöckler and Bunting 2006); one male was also shot by a Russian hunter near the Chinese border in 2008 (Zöckler and Syroechkovskiy 2008). Small but significant numbers of birds and their eggs have been collected for scientific purposes in the last 20 years, with one small colony completely wiped out due to this activity (Zöckler and Bunting 2006). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and other species dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 57% of the breeding habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000).   ",

It is threatened by extensive coastal development within its range, especially as it occurs primarily in back mangrove areas. There has been at least a 27% loss of mangrove area in countries within this species range between 1980 and 2005 (FAO 2007).All mangrove ecosystems occur within mean sea level and high tidal elevations, and have distinct species zonations that are controlled by the elevation of the substrate relative to mean sea level. This is because of associated variation in frequency of elevation, salinity and wave action (Duke et al. 1998). With rise in sea-level, the habitat requirements of each species will be disrupted, and species zones will suffer mortality at their present locations and re-establish at higher elevations in areas that were previously landward zones (Ellison 2005). If sea-level rise is a continued trend over this century, then there will be continued mortality and re-establishment of species zones. However, species that are easily dispersed and fast growing/fast producing will cope better than those which are slower growing and slower to reproduce. In addition, mangrove area is declining globally due to a number of localized threats. The main threat is habitat destruction and removal of mangrove areas. Reasons for removal include cleared for shrimp farms, agriculture, fish ponds, rice production and salt pans, and for the development of urban and industrial areas, road construction, coconut plantations, ports, airports, and tourist resorts. Other threats include pollution from sewage effluents, solid wastes, siltation, oil, and agricultural and urban runoff. Climate change is also thought to be a threat, particularly at the edges of a species range. Natural threats include cyclones, hurricane and tsunamis.",

Due to urban and military development on Guam there are several sites on the island where the species is no longer found. For example, the first records of the species were from 1916–1918 in Upe district in central Guam, but these sites are now part of the Andersen Air Force Base (USFWS 1994, Wiles et al. 1996). Herbivores, particularly introduced species, are reported to graze on Hayun Lago trees and other native plant species (USFWS 1994, Wiles et al. 1996). Introduced deer are reported to eat Hayun Lago seedlings and feral pigs and domestic cattle eat the young plants and can destroy them through trampling (Wiles et al. 1996). Insect infestations at all stages of the Hayun Lago's lifecycle are a major threat. Infested pods and seeds were observed during research, reducing recruitment of the next generation (Wiles et al. 1996). Mealybugs are a serious threat, feeding on mature trees, seedlings and reintroduced plants (C. Harrington pers. comm. 2016). It is suspected that Hayun Lago has no genetic adaptions to tolerate insect infestations from introduced mealybug species (Wiles et al. 1996). Caterpillars of the Eurema blanda butterfly, scale insects, whitefly, slugs and beetles are also problem pests of reintroduced plants of Hayun Lago (C. Harrington pers. comm. 2016). Typhoons are common on Guam and Rota and severe typhoons can cause extensive damage to forests (Wiles et al. 1996). As Hayun Lago has a small population size it is particularly vulnerable and trees were reported to be killed or damaged during recent typhoons (Wiles et al. 1996). Other possible threats to Hayun Lago include wildfires, damage to branches from introduced birds, strangling figs growing up the trees and degradation of forest habitat due to invasive plant species (Wiles et al. 1996, USFWS 2012).",

Threats to the species are likely to vary across its range and might include predation by feral cats and foxes; soil disturbance, erosion and loss caused by herbivores (including livestock and over-abundant native and feral herbivores); degradation of habitat around water points by herbivores; competition for food by herbivores; fire; psittacine beak and feather disease, avian pox, and other diseases; illegal collection of birds or eggs; disturbance from bird watching activities; fences; and reduction in water availability through over-use of waterholes by camels and reduced waterhole maintenance (TSSC 2016). Biophysical modelling suggests that predicted temperature increases under various climate change scenarios would increase night parrots’ dependence on free-standing water dramatically (S. Murphy in litt. 2016). Thus, climate change, interacting with the spatial configuration of water points and habitats, and the concentration of feral predators at water points, may become a serious future threat.",

The species may have been restricted to its current breeding range since the arrival of Europeans (Carlile et al. 2003). The most serious current threat is predation by introduced vertebrates including Indian mongoose Herpestes javanicus, feral cats, Common Barn-owls Tyto alba, rats, dogs, and pigs. Although not yet established on Kaua'i and Lana'i islands, mongooses represent an ongoing major threat to nestling and adult birds at breeding colonies on the other islands within the Hawaiian Petrel’s range. Feral cat and rat depredation, where unmanaged on other islands, continues to limit recovery capacity. Considerable efforts are ongoing to reduce the impact of cat predation on the species with cat-proof fences erected on Maui and Mauna Loa. Adults and nestlings are very susceptible to predation, as nests are on the ground, and they are naïve to predators.Some areas of nesting habitat have been lost to the pressures of modern urbanisation and degraded by feral goats and pigs and weeds. Nest burrows are trampled by feral goats, mouflon sheep and Chital Deer Axis axis (Mitchell et al. 2005, H. T. Harvey and Associates 2015) however, these are now excluded from the largest colony and deer are not present at the majority of sites. On Lana'i, habitat degradation caused by the invasive tree, Strawberry Guava Psidium cattleianum, is considered to be the biggest threat to the long term survival of the colony (J. Penniman in litt. 2007). In the past, considerable amounts of the Hawaiian Petrel’s habitat were converted for livestock, however as the majority of colonies are now protected, this represents a much reduced threat.",

Current estimates are 16-60 birds caught annually (Richard & Abraham 2015) but this is likely an underestimate and modelling suggests that even these low numbers are sufficient to drive significant population declines (Crawford et al. 2017). Recreational gillnets are likely to have had an effect on the Yellow-eyed Penguin population, but are currently banned within coastal waters of up to 4 miles around the South Island (Crawford et al. 2017) and, as such, represent less of a threat. However, if this ban were lifted, this threat would be of similar magnitude to the large-scale gillnets that principally operate further out. Furthermore, fisheries activities appear to affect prey availability and prey quality (Mattern 2007; Browne et al. 2011), and influence penguin foraging behaviour (Mattern et al. 2013). Modelling has found a likely correlation between changing sea surface temperature and penguin vital rates, whereby productivity and survival are projected to decline under predicted climate change (Mattern et al. 2017). This has been seen in the Boulder Beach colony, where changes in SST have been found to account for 33% of the population fluctuations (Mattern et al. 2017).Introduced ferret Mustela furo, stoat M. erminea, unleashed dogs Canis lupus familiaris, and possibly feral cats Felis catus, are predators in the South Island. Predation by pigs Sus domesticus on the main Auckland Island and in the Catlins is known to occur (B. McKinlay per D. Houston in litt. 2012). A rogue female New Zealand sea lion Phocarctos hookeri and her daughter had been estimated to eat 20-30 birds annually on the Otago Peninsula (Lalas et al. 2007), but they have since died of natural causes. Accidental fires in breeding areas are a known, but infrequent, threat. Repeated adult die-off events remain little understood but might be due to toxins (Gill and Darby 1993). Disease appears to be a problem in some populations in some years, with diphtheritic stomatitis (caused by the bacteria Corynebacterium spp.) and the blood parasite Leucocytozoon tawaki, formerly only known from Fiordland penguins, causes of mortality for chicks (Argilla et al. 2013). Human disturbance, particularly from unregulated tourists at breeding areas, negatively affects energy budgets, fledgling weight and probability of survival (McClung et al. 2004; Ellenberg et al. 2007, 2009, 2013). ",

The introduction of the House Rat Rattus rattus to Chrismas Island in the 2000s is of considerable concern (Pierce et al. 2015), but its spread seems to have been relatively slow and it was not thought to have reached breeding islets by 2015 (R.

Goats and dogs are also present, however, these are thought to cause negligible declines.  Light pollution represents a significant threat due to the disorientation of juvenile birds and has been the target of Intensive conservation action. Light pollution is estimated to potentially lead to between 5 and 20% mortality dependent on weather and moon phase (M. LeCorre in litt. 2016); over 13,000 fledglings have been rescued since 1996 (M. LeCorre in litt. 2016). Widespread light pollution such as street lamps and sport installations are responsible for the vast majority of petrel light-induced mortality on Réunion (Le Corre et al. 2002).  Climate change may also affect the species in the future as a recent study based on a robust tracking dataset and habitat suitability modelling has shown that the wintering habitat may shift southward and may be reduced in size during the 21st century (Legrand et al. 2016).

In Australian waters, up to c. 400 individuals (over 80% juvenile) were killed annually in 1989-1995 by Japanese longliners (Gales et al. 1998). Despite mainly foraging over oceanic waters, the species also interacts with longline fisheries targeting Patagonian Toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides in shelf areas (ACAP 2009). In the Indian Ocean, illegal or unregulated fishing for Patagonian Toothfish killed an estimated 10,000-20,000 albatrosses (mainly this species) in 1997 and 1998 (CCAMLR 1997, CCAMLR 1998). Due to its circumpolar distribution, T. chrysostoma is potentially vulnerable to Southern Ocean pelagic fisheries worldwide (with the exception of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone; G. Taylor in litt. 2008). The extensive use of the Subtropical Convergence and Sub-Antarctic Zones by incubating birds from Marion Island, especially females, bring them into contact with intense Southern Bluefin Tuna Thunnus maccoyii longline fishing activity in international waters (40-45°) (ACAP 2009). In addition, bycatch of Grey-headed Albatross has also been recorded in the poorly regulated small-scale longline operations off the coast of Peru, suggesting that mortality in these operations is also significant (Mangel 2012).   Long-term declines on Campbell began well before local longline fishery development, and appear to be caused by environmental factors, possibly rising sea-surface temperatures resulting in food shortages. Pardo et al. (2017) demonstrated that adult mortality from bycatch was exacerbated by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and associated reductions in food availability, indicating that periodic temperature extremes are at least contributing to a significant population decline.  Another threat is posed by introduced House Mice Mus musculus.

Since 1987, the species has been known to make up a substantial proportion of bycatch in the longline tuna fishery in New Zealand waters. In 2006, 58 birds were captured during a single fishing trip in this region, with significant mortality also occurring in the Chilean pelagic longline swordfish fishery (ACAP 2009). The species’ foraging area overlaps with the Australian Eastern Tuna and Billfish fisheries, the Korean and Taiwanese fleets targeting Albacore Tuna Thunnus alalunga in the Pacific and the Spanish long-line fleet targeting swordfish Xiphias gladius. The level of threat from fisheries is currently increasing, and individuals, particularly females, are observed to extending the travel distance on foraging trips. Shifts in the at-sea distribution of non-breeding females may also be related to changing oceanic conditions driven by climate change, impacting on food resources and potentially increasing the risk from bycatch. The interaction between climate change and bycatch is a likely explanation for the observed faster decline of the female population relative to the male population (Walker et al. 1995, Walker and Elliot 1999, Elliott et al. 2016). In 2005 and 2006, female annual survival was as low as 80%, eight percent below male survival, and there is now a strong sex imbalance within the population (Elliott and Walker 2014, Elliott et al. 2016), further reducing the effective population size. The impact of at-sea threats is also exemplified by the recent decline in the two main populations on the Antipodes and Adams Island. The sub-population was previously increasing, but has now declined by 6% and 12% respectively, in the absence of any apparent land-based threats (ACAP 2017). Pigs Sus domesticus may be responsible for the near-extirpation of the species on Auckland Island, and probably still take eggs and chicks, while feral cats Felis catus potentially also contributing to chick mortality (Taylor 2000).

In 1985, a cyclonic storm hit the breeding sites on the Chatham Islands, reducing soil cover and destroying most vegetation (Robertson 1998). Mortality due to longline and trawling fishing activities has been recorded (Croxall and Gales 1998, Taylor 2000), but the relatively high survival rates of adults and juveniles at the Taiaroa Head colony suggest that fisheries-related mortality is not a major threat to the species (ACAP 2009). There is currently no data from the Chatham Islands. There is a history of significant harvesting of the species on the Chatham Islands by local residents. Harvesting of chicks may still occur, although now illegal, but this is likely to be limited in extent (ACAP 2009). At Taiaroa Head, predator control aims to reduce predation by introduced Common Green Bottleflies Lucilia sericata, stoats Mustela erminea and cats Felis catus (Croxall and Gales 1998), which may be contributing to population declines.",

Estimates suggest that up to 600 birds are killed annually, comprising mainly adults in the winter months and immatures during the summer fishing season (Gales 1998, Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998). Yellow-nosed Albatross species are killed in pelagic longline fisheries off southern Africa (Ryan et al. 2002), and occasionally in South African trawl fisheries (B. Watkins in litt. 2008). During the breeding season, it comes into contact with tuna longliners in subtropical waters (Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998), and birds (mostly adult males) have been taken by Patagonian Toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides longliners in the vicinity of the Prince Edward Islands (Ryan and Boix-Hinzen 1999). Skewed sex ratios contributed to reducing the effective population size.  The causative agents of avian cholera Pasteurella multocida and Erysipelas Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae are present in the species’ range and pose a potential risk to the population (ACAP 2009). Avian cholera appears to be the cause of the considerably high mortality rates of young chicks that have been recurring erratically but frequently in the population on Amsterdam Island, and has led to dramatic reductions in productivity over the past decade (Weimerskirch 2016). The disease mainly affects young chicks, but adults may also be affected (Weimerskirch 2004). Subsequent declines in certain colonies could be due to dispersal following failed breeding (Rolland et al. 2009). Erysipelas, while widespread, appears to have little impact on the population in comparison with avian cholera (Uhart et al. 2017).  On Amsterdam Island, past habitat destruction by introduced cattle has degraded the breeding sites but fencing of cattle has reduced their impact in recent years (ACAP 2009).",

Cats and pigs have been eradicated from Baltra and Santiago respectively, although are still thought to represent a significant threat to the Galapagos Petrel on other islands through predation of eggs, young and adults. Goats, donkeys, dogs and other introduced mammals still exist in some areas of the petrel’s range but are thought to represent a much less significant threat. Depredation also occurs from native species, primarily the the Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus and the Galapagos Hawk Buteo galapagoensis, however, there is no clear reason to suspect this is occurring at levels high enough to drive declines.  El Niño events seem to have a detrimental impact on nesting and productivity. This species is potentially susceptible to changes in sea temperature, such as due to ENSO events and climate change, which may affect food supplies (D. Wiedenfeld in litt. 2012, BirdLife International unpubl. data).  Some areas of breeding habitat have been lost to the invasive Blackberry plant, and less so to the Cinchona. Although habitat has previously been threatened by farming activity, the majority of breeding sites are now within Areas of Conservation within the zoning system of protected areas within the Gálapagos National Park, with most colonies fenced or livestock removed from the area.",

Cats were introduced to Socorro in the early 1970s, and more than 92% of cat scats above 500 m contain shearwater remains (J. Martínez Gómez in litt. 1998, 1999, 2000). Most shearwaters are taken by cats when they land in parts of the forest where the understorey is practically absent (Martínez-Gómez and Jacobsen 2004). The introduction of pigs to Isla Clarion in 1979 led to local extinction of the species by 1990 (Howell and Webb 1990, Everett and Pitman 1993). Subsequently pigs have been eradicated from the island and some other shearwater species (though not this species as yet) have been recorded returning to the island to breed (Wanless et al. 2009). Sheep and goats are destroying nesting habitat across some parts of the colonies, through overgrazing and soil compaction (Santaella and Sada 1991). However, the largest breeding grounds were found in the north and northwest of Socorro’s mountain summit where the vegetation has not been severely damaged by introduced herbivores. Feral sheep and goats were completely eradicated from Socorro in 2012, resulting in a rapid and remarkable recovery of the local vegetation cover (Ortiz-Alcaraz et al. 2017). Rabbits were introduced to Isla Clarion in 1979 and caused significant damage to nesting habitat and directly competed with Townsend's Shearwaters for burrows, which is likely to have hastened the extinction of the species on the island (Santaella and Sada 1991, Everett and Pitman 1993). House Mice have also been identified as having a significant negative impact on the species on Socorro (Islands Conservation in prep.). The presence of rats on the island has been reported, but not confirmed, however it is a likely future scenario which would be likely to drive further rapid declines (J. Martínez Gómez in litt. 1998, 1999, 2000).   Other threats include volcanic eruptions – the San Benedicto population was obliterated by a volcanic eruption in 1952 (Everett and Pitman 1993) – as well as sea-level rise and climate change (BirdLife International unpubl. data) and human developments; the construction of a new airstrip in 2009 is believed to have caused the death of an unknown number of birds due to light pollution associated with nocturnal works (Carboneras et al. 2014).

Management measures have been introduced to mitigate fisheries interactions, but declines in Sea Lion numbers have not ceased.

Projecting the pup estimate from 1997/98 (3,021) at the Auckland Islands for three generations forward with a decline of 4%/year, the number of pups born in 2029/30 is estimated to be 840, which is a 72% reduction meeting the category Endangered under criterion A4bd. A population viability analysis (PVA) has also been carried out on the largest population (in the Aukland Islands), which predicts a 98% probability of extinction of this population within five generations (calculation based on model used in Chilvers 2012b).",

The population has yet to fully recover from the period of overexploitation (Childerhouse and Gales 1998).At the present time, New Zealand Sea Lions have a highly restricted distribution, a small population, and nearly all of the breeding activity is concentrated in two subantarctic island groups. This restricted and small breeding population in combination makes them vulnerable to disease outbreaks, environmental change, and human activities.The commercial Arrow Squid trawl fishery near the Auckland Islands reported their first New Zealand Sea Lion bycatch mortalities in 1978.  Reported or estimated mortality between 1995 and 2007 averaged 92 animals annually (range 17-143) which was 3.7% of the estimated number of mature individuals in the Auckland Island area (Thompson and Abraham 2009). Of particular concern is that most bycatch animals are females (up to 91%; Chilvers 2008). New Zealand Sea Lions are also incidentally caught in other trawl fisheries around the Auckland and Campbell Islands (Chilvers 2008, Thompson et al. 2013). Apart from direct mortality, competition and habitat modification caused by fishing activity may also be impacting New Zealand Sea Lion foraging areas (Robertson and Chilvers 2011).Epizootic outbreaks at the Auckland Islands in 1998, 2002, and 2003 led to more than 50%, 33%, and 21% early pup mortality respectively, and were also responsible for the deaths of some animals from other age classes during 1998. The source of the suspected bacterial agent and cause of the outbreak and subsequent mortality for the 1998 outbreak are unknown, however the 2002 and 2003 outbreaks have been identified as being caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (Castinel et al. 2007b).",

It is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR B1ab(i,ii,iv,v); C2a(ii)) since it has a very restricted geographic range (extent of occurrence (EOO) is 30 km2), the population is severely fragmented and there is continuing decline in the EOO, area of occupancy (AOO), number of subpopulations and mature individuals. At least one subpopulation has completely disappeared due to over-collection by shell collectors and traders. The two known extant subpopulations are remarkably fragmented and localized over very small areas, with one further subpopulation considered extinct. The frequent shrub fires also represent a tangible threat for the species. Increasingly long drought periods in summer could be the cause of the reduction in the number of mature individuals recently detected (2014) compared with a 2005 survey. The species requires an extensive monitoring program, a protection plan and must be assessed again within a short period of time.",

        "threat": "Disturbance on breeding grounds (e.g. from increasing tourism, angling and reindeer husbandry) causes much disruption to nesting birds in Fennoscandia (Madsen 1996, N. Mikander in litt. 2016). Disturbance by hunters can be a significant limiting factor on survival and breeding output (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995, N. Petkov in litt. 2007). Illegal spring hunting and round-ups of moulting birds are taking place on the Russian breeding grounds (Jones in press) and illegal shooting continues in Norway (T. Aarvak pers. comm. 2007). In autumn and winter, illegal killing (including by poisoning; A. Fox in litt. 2016) and accidental shooting on the staging and wintering grounds is the most important threat (Madsen 1996, Aarvak et al.1997, Lorentsen et al. 1998, Kear 2005, Morozov 2006, Jones in press). In the Western Palearctic, at least 20-30% of the population are shot each year (Mooij 2010), often accidentally during hunting of other species. Habitat deterioration, as a result of land cultivation and increased water-levels in the Caspian Sea, is a further threat (Madsen 1996), as is habitat loss through the creation of reservoirs for hydroelectric power in Scandinavia (Madsen 1996). The species may also be threatened by nest predation from the Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and Arctic Fox Alopex lagopus (Madsen 1996, V. Morozov in litt. 2016). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 28% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000). The wintering population at Dongting Lake, China, is considered to now be relatively stable, but the concentration of the majority of birds in this population at one site makes it extremely vulnerable to any factor that could affect this locality (Cong et al. 2012), most notably with changing hydrology and water quality of the Yangtze River (A. Fox in litt. 2016). This is especially the case because the species is reliant on specialist recessional grasslands in spring and autumn (Wang et al. 2012, 2013). In the region of Kaliningrad, Russia, important migratory stop-over points on the Baltic Sea coastline are being degraded through petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for agriculture, changes in wetland management leading to scrub and reed overgrowth, peat extraction, and the burning and mowing of reed beds (Grishanov 2006).",

        "threat": "Within Europe the main threat to this species is the intensification of agriculture. Ploughing of pasture and irrigation have reduced available habitat while the removal of marginal areas of semi-natural vegetation and the increased application of agro-chemicals has reduced food availability and these practices have probably been responsible for the extinctions in some areas. On the remaining grasslands, overgrazing affects the vegetation composition and structure, reducing both food availability and cover for nesting. Conversely, land abandonment is also a major threat, as the open, treeless steppe habitat is quickly lost when grazing is removed. Hunting, which is legal in Turkey during the breeding season, may be a significant threat in parts of the range; the species's habit of concentrating in large numbers at traditional drinking sites throughout the year means that it forms an attractive and relatively easy target (Tucker and Heath 1994).In Morocco it remains by far the commonest sandgrouse but there are local declines owing to hunting pressure (I. Cherkaoui in litt. 2017). In Tunisia hunting remains legal during the breeding season, and loss of wetlands has led to birds becoming more concentrated where water remains and hence more vulnerable to hunting pressure (H. Azafzaf in litt. 2017).",

        "threat": "This species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as increased sea surface temperature (SST) and associated shifts in prey (e.g. Herring, Sandeel) distribution, abundance and quality (Durant et al. 2003, Sandvik et al. 2005). Breeding failures are usually assumed to be due to food shortages (e.g. Martin 1989, Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006, Harris and Wanless 2011, Anker-Nilssen et al. 2016), as changing temperatures can cause mismatches between plankton blooms, prey abundance peaks and Puffin breeding seasons, leading to poor chick growth, shortened nesting periods and lower fledging success (Durant et al. 2006). Sandvik et al. (2005) demonstrated decreased survival in North Atlantic seabirds (including the puffin) with increasing SST. There are several recorded examples of food stock collapse and its detrimental consequences for Puffins; The Sandeel population collapse near Shetland in 1985-1990 led to successive years of breeding failures (Mitchell et al. 2004), and another Sandeel crash in South and West Iceland and the Faroes in 2003-2005 led to food scarcity and collapse of Puffin populations with some colonies having 0% breeding success (Hansen and Sigurdsson in litt. 2016).  Extreme weather and storms can cause mass mortality of seabirds, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter storms at sea, and represents a potentially growing threat due to the predicted increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (Melillo et al. 2014). In Pop Witless Bay, extreme cold and wet weather in 2011 caused the death of thousands of chicks across Witless Bay Reserve (Wilhelm et al. 2015). A severe wreck in March 2016 also delayed breeding on Isle of May (Newell 2016). The 2002 Norway wreck could have caused the death of as many as 100,000 birds, diagnosed as prolonged exposure to adverse feeding conditions at sea (but may also have been caused by disease or climatic factors affecting prey abundance) (Anker-Nilssen et al. 2013). A large wreck occurred in March 2013 along the coast of Scotland/northeastern UK, also coinciding with periods of extreme weather (3,055 and 1,364 birds collected on Scottish and English coast, respectively), where the majority died of starvation, likely due to difficulty feeding at sea (Harris and Elkins 2013). Productivity fell to 0.46 in the Farne islands in 2015 due to flooding caused by two major storms that destroyed nests with chicks (Wildlife review 2015). More such examples have been recorded throughout the species’ range.  The threat of climate change to food stocks is exacerbated by the unsustainable harvesting of prey species by commercial fisheries, causing further reductions in food availability and subsequent low breeding success (Breton and Diamond 2014). Major fisheries have been noted as contributing to the collapse of key prey fish species since the 1960s and been linked to reproductive failure at colonies such as Røst, Norway (reduced recruitment due to food shortage in breeding season is considered the most likely cause of decline during 1986-2012) (Tasker et al. 2000, Anker-Nilssen et al. 2003, Miles et al. 2015). In addition to overharvesting of prey stocks, commercial fisheries are a cause of direct mortality. The Atlantic Puffin’s foraging strategy (diving) makes the species susceptible to being caught in gillnets and other fishing gear, but bycatch has not been recorded in significantly large numbers (Tasker et al. 2000, Rogan and Mackey 2007) and likely has a “trivial effect” on Puffin populations (Harris and Wanless 2011).  At the breeding colonies, the species is vulnerable to invasive predators. American Mink Neovison vison is known to take puffins from burrows, and the escape of mink from fur farms in Iceland in the early 1930s drove many colonies to extinction in the following decades (Harris and Wanless 2011). Mink are still causing low rates of chick survival in parts of the range, including Hornøya, Norway (Barrett 2015). Rats Rattus spp. depredate eggs and chicks and have been linked to drastic colony declines and local extinctions in Sweden (Harris and Wanless 2011), on the Faroe Islands (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007), Lundy Island (Lock 2006), Shiant Islands (Lockley 1953), and Ailsa Craig and Puffin Islands (Mitchell et al. 2004) (see also TemaNord 2010). Recolonisation and population recovery can be seen after rat eradication (Lock 2006).  Hunting of puffins, mostly for human consumption, is allowed on the Faeroe Islands and Iceland (Thorup et al. 2014), yet uncontrolled harvesting in nesting grounds may lead to local declines. Adult birds are taken during the nesting season, thus causing reduced reproductive success and significant adult mortality, in addition to the general effects of disturbance. 10,000 individuals were recorded to be taken annually in the Nólsoy colony (Faeroes) and 150,000 in Iceland. This is suspected to limit recovery of populations and may exceed recruitment rate on Iceland, while the Nólsoy population is considered stable only due to migration (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007). The species is particularly vulnerable to disturbance when nesting, and human intrusion associated with other recreational activities (tourism, walks) may also impact the species. Nest desertions have been recorded (Nettleship et al. 2014), and at one study site a 40% decrease in breeding success was seen in a frequently visited area compared to the control site (Rodway et al. 1996).  The species is also vulnerable to oil spills and other forms of marine pollution. Past oil spills have had severe impacts on affected puffin populations; the wreck of the Torrey Canyon in 1967 was linked to decline in puffin numbers at Sept-Iles (Brittany) and the wreck of the oil tanker Amoco Cadiz (1978) badly affected moulting puffins in the region, killing 1,391 confirmed puffins which coincided with a 44% reduction in the Sept-Iles population. The number of Puffins killed is likely an underestimate, as many will not be recovered or identified on beaches after wrecks (Harris and Wanless 2011). Oiled puffins are often unable to fly, accentuating the effects of reduced food supplies and extreme weather preventing feeding. However, other oil spills seem to have had less effect on Puffin populations; the Tricolor spill in 2003 (Netherlands) was not found to have been a major cause of a local puffin wreck (35% of birds were oiled, most after death) (Camphuysen 2003). Nonetheless, the greatest impact of oil spills is likely to be on long-term condition of adults and ecosystem degradation, imposing a further risk to the Atlantic Puffin’s food resources. Various incidences of other marine pollutants have been recorded in the species; in 1970 21% of carcasses found in Scotland, and 22% of those shot off the coast of Norway contained elastic threads and other plastic particles (nylon thread, plastic beads etc). Given that the same proportion of pollutants were measured in healthy and deceased Puffins on Isle of May, pollution is regarded unlikely to be the primary cause of death, but may still pose a risk by accumulating over time and accentuating other threats for individuals already compromised by low food availability, adverse climatic conditions or hunting. The highest proportion of pollutants were found in first year birds, which may be explained by higher mortality among young birds with higher loads and only the less polluted birds reaching adulthood (Harris and Wanless 2011).  Increasing numbers of offshore windfarms could result in displacement, but the risk of collision is considered very low (Bradbury et al. 2014). However, a study into puffin vision suggests they may be vulnerable to collision with man-made objects related to underwater wind farms (Martin and Wanless 2015).",

It is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR B1ab(i,ii,iv,v); C2a(ii)) since it has a very restricted geographic range (extent of occurrence (EOO) is 30 km2), the population is severely fragmented and there is continuing decline in the EOO, area of occupancy (AOO), number of subpopulations and mature individuals. At least one subpopulation has completely disappeared due to over-collection by shell collectors and traders. The two known extant subpopulations are remarkably fragmented and localized over very small areas, with one further subpopulation considered extinct. The frequent shrub fires also represent a tangible threat for the species. Increasingly long drought periods in summer could be the cause of the reduction in the number of mature individuals recently detected (2014) compared with a 2005 survey. The species requires an extensive monitoring program, a protection plan and must be assessed again within a short period of time.",

It was previously known from a single specimen collected in Boke, Guinea in 1947. Because of this the extent of occurrence for this species is here revised upward to an estimated 5,000 sq km (EN B1a), with an estimated area of occupancy of less than 500 sq km (EN B2a) due to its restriction to year-round wetland areas in guinea savannah and altered rainforest. Because of the discovery of new populations of this species (and the promise of finding other populations), its conservation status is downgraded from CR to EN. Available information on population size and trends and on the number of mature individuals is insufficient to estimate actual population size (for criterion C), but the scarcity of specimens implies a small population size (estimated to be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals) with no subpopulation estimated to contain more than 250 individuals i.e. EN C2a(i). There is a likely trend towards declining numbers due to increased habitat destruction relating to expanding human populations and more intensive agriculture in northwest Guinea. No quantitative analysis of the probability of extinction has been carried out to assess the species under criterion E.",

New, sophisticated traps for catching this species are now being used in the Nkongsamba area of Cameroon. Large scale collection for the international pet trade is growing and also contributing to the decline of this species (N. Gonwouo pers. comm. November 2016), with animals imported from Cameroon to the USA on a regular basis by animal dealers for zoos, the pet trade and, in the past, for competitive frog races (one estimate of this trade was 300 animals per year). There has been at least one instance of an import into Europe that did not satisfy legal requirements leading to customs seizure (T. Doherty-Bone pers. comm. November 2018).It is also adversely affected by the loss of forest habitat for agriculture (including the creation of new cocoa plantations, banana plantations, and palm plantations), logging and human settlements. With the creation of a new roads network to extract and commercialise products from these plantations, the habitat of this species is now more accessible to people (N. Gonwouo pers. comm. January 2018). Other threats to its habitat include sedimentation of its breeding streams and the dumping of chemicals in river tributaries by locals often in streams around farms and villages (N. Gonwouo pers. comm. February 2017) where the species reproduces, which is likely to affect tadpole development (N. Gonwouo pers. comm. November 2016).",

Additionally, rampant coastal development is increasingly threatening the northern half of this species' narrow coastal distribution range; almost total transformation of this coastal strip is expected in the coming decade and certainly within the next 19.5 years (three generations), with a corresponding population decline expected to exceed 30% over this time period which is made even worse by the collection for the pet trade, and it therefore also qualifies as Vulnerable applying Criterion A3cd.",

Cattle roam unfettered among many colonies which are not being regenerated because the animals either trample or may eat juveniles. In other sites, fires are set to create pastureland or the thorny leaves are burnt to facilitate access to the trunks' starch which becomes cattle fodder. Pith removal, of course, kills the plant.",

In Canton Cotacachi, Imbabura, 45% of households still use firewood and charcoal for cooking and heating, contributing to the destruction of key habitat (Jahn and Santander 2008). The situation is similar on the west slope of Volcán Pichincha, where some families still produce charcoal for auto-consumption and commercialisation in Quito (Jahn & Santander 2008). Suitable habitat on ridge-crests is disappearing more rapidly than surrounding vegetation, because the crests provide flat ground for cultivating potatoes and livestock-grazing within otherwise steep terrain (Bleiweiss and Olalla 1983). The Toisán population is threatened by rapid deforestation on the south-west slope of the cordillera, copper mining concessions, and invasions of landless farmers within the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve (Jahn 2008, Jahn and Santander 2008). Some ridges where it formerly occurred are now almost completely devoid of natural vegetation, and even if it still occurs in these areas it is unlikely to be numerous. Around 93 % of the suitable habitat within its probable historic range has been degraded or destroyed (Williams and Santander 2003), with 97 % lost in Pinchincha Province (Santander et al. 2004). Human-induced fires threaten large tracts of forest during the dry season (Jahn 2008). The construction of a pipeline at Cerro Chiquilipe led to habitat destruction for the pipeline itself, an access road and a depressurisation station despite the known presence of the hummingbird (Santander et al. 2004). Volcán Pichincha has sporadically erupted since 1999, and ash-fall in the area has been considerable. The impacts of this on the species and its habitat are unknown. Climate change in the future may push the climate zone for this species above the current treeline (Jahn 2008), and could lead to increased competition with Gorgeted Sunangel Heliangelus strophianus as that species expands its altitudinal range (Jahn 2008, Guevara 2013). However, the current treeline is thought to be lower than it was historically owing to centuries of anthropogenic stresses (particularly fire) causing the gradual loss and fragmentation of high altitude forest (Jahn 2008).

Until about 2005, Cozumel was still relatively well-conserved, with close to 90% of the island covered by natural vegetation (Romero-Nájera 2004, Romero-Nájera et al. 2007), but the situation is deteriorating  rapidly. The interior of the island is less developed, but Pygmy Raccoon is rare or absent there (Cuarón et al. 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  There is only a very small area of prime raccoon habitat and this is on the coast where most of the tourist development is taking place.The expansion and widening of the road system is fragmenting the vegetation of the island in at least three areas (Cuarón et al. 2004, de Villa-Meza et al. 2011). The widening of roads is potentially increasing their barrier effect and exacerbating their impact on the conservation of Pygmy Raccoon and other native species (de Villa-Meza et al. 2011). Most cases of Pygmy Raccoon mortality documented since 2001 have been the result of animals being run over by cars on the island's highways (García-Vasco 2005).Alien invasive predators, such as the snake Boa constrictor, as well as domestic and feral dogs, may have an important impact on the Pygmy Raccoon population and it is confirmed that feral dogs predate them (Martínez-Morales and Cuarón 1999, García-Vasco 2005, Bautista 2006).  Additionally, introduced carnivores to the island could easily become a source of parasites and pathogens that could potentially affect negatively Pygmy Raccoon populations (Cuarón et al. 2004, McFadden et al. 2005, Mena 2007).  The introduction of the closely related Northern Raccoon P. lotor (there are frequent vehicle ferries between the island and mainland), usually for pets, is a risk of genetic introgression and a potential source of parasites and pathogens (Cuarón et al. 2004).Hurricanes are the main natural threat recognized for the Cozumel biota (Cuarón et al. 2004, Perdomo 2006, Barillas 2007, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  For Pygmy Raccoon, hurricanes cause drastic population decline, reduction in the proportion of juveniles, direct injury, and facilitate pathological change (Copa-Alvaro 2007, Mena 2007). The frequency, magnitude and duration of hurricanes in the Caribbean Basin is increasing (Goldenberg et al. 2001), so they are an issue of major concern because there may be a synergistic effect with anthropogenic disturbance.Hunting and collection of Pygmy Raccoons as pets is currently not an important threat.",

        "Description": "This species is listed as Endangered due to an ongoing and suspected future decline inferred from habitat loss, fragmentation and hunting pressure. Population declines are estimated to be greater than 50% in the past 3 generations (33 years). Furthermore the causes of population decline have not ceased and are inferred to be greater than 50% decline in the next 3 generations (33 years). This is inferred from current trends of continued habitat loss, hunting estimates as well impacts of climate change, which will shift the suitable climatic conditions up the mountain. In addition there are estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining, with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% in the next 2 generations (22 years). There has been and remains significant hunting pressure in Ecuador, however in Colombia and Peru the hunting pressure on this species still continues. It is extremely rare to encounter an area with Mountain Tapirs where they are not being over-hunted. Overall the mountain tapir population is fragmented as a result of human activities. There has also been widespread cattle introduction into the last remaining mountain tapir refuges. For example, cattle have been observed to be forming reproducing families in western Sangay National Park. Illegal mining is an important threat that is increasing population fragmentation, increasing contamination of watersheds and increasing illegal hunting. Mining projects in northern Peru and central Andes of Colombia threatens to destroy the headwater cloud forests and paramos of the scant population of mountain tapirs there.",

        "threat": "Formerly hunting pressure was the primary threat through most areas of the Mountain Tapir’s distribution (C. Downer pers. comm.) but today, poppy growing and its eradication, warfare and habitat fragmentation are currently the main threats on this species (E. Constantino pers. comm.). In some areas, hunting is decreasing due to local regulations and people’s increased awareness of this species’ rarity and conservation status. While a few Mountain Tapir populations may benefit because guerrilla presence which may relieve colonization pressure in Colombia by promoting the abandonment of conflict areas (C. Downer pers. comm.), most local biologists feel the presence of the guerrilla is having an overall negative impact on the species’ conservation. Additionally, the “actors” of the armed conflicts in Colombia (army, guerrilla, and paramilitaries) see the presence of field biologists and researchers in the areas that they control as a threat for their safety (Dávalos 2001, Semple 2000). The slow reproduction rate, large home range, and generally solitary nature of Mountain Tapirs make them particularly vulnerable to destruction of habitat and fragmentation by encroaching agriculture (Downer 1997). Habitat fragmentation is caused by conversion of forests and páramos to cattle ranching and agricultural lands. Another major threat to mountain tapirs in Colombia and Peru is the development of new mining projects and illegal mining contaminating water sources.The major threat to mountain tapirs in Colombia is human population growth in the Andean region.  People settling in the region need land, consumables and services, and their activities lead to habitat destruction.  Additional threats include the development of hydroelectric dams, highways crossing protected areas, petroleum exploration, and electrical networks etc. There are numerous reports of tapir being hit by cars so infrastructure development through habitat is a potential major threat. There are numerous proposed highway and other projects in the Andes which would greatly increase vehicular mortalities. Once the construction of these highways is finalized, the vehicles will be able to drive at high speed and the animals crossing the roads will become even more vulnerable. Additionally, these roads will provide easier access to poachers, given the fact that the park lacks enough park rangers to patrol and protect the area. Tapir skin was used in the past for manufacture working tools (backpacks, ropes to ride horses, baskets etc.) and other things such as carpets and covers for beds. Traditional medicine makes use of tapir parts for medicinal purposes being commercialized in local markets.  Also tapir parts are prescribed for medicinal purposes  by shamans. Widespread cattle introduction into the last remaining Mountain Tapir refuges is a serious problem which will likely escalate in the near future. Cattle is a serious risk of transmission of infectious diseases and other etiological agents that they may carry. Disease transmission from cattle has been documented for Mountain, Baird’s and lowland tapirs in other locations. Another problem in Colombia are the fumigations being conducted in National Parks and all zones where cultivation of drugs can be found, including Andean forests in the Central and Oriental Cordilleras. These fumigations are authorized and promoted by the Colombian government, and are a major threat for the mountain tapir populations. The habitat is seriously affected and the animals can possibly be poisoned when in contact with the poison used for the fumigations (Round-Up), which is selective but can affect the availability of food resources.In Peru, there is a lack of protected areas big enough to maintain viable populations. Also the enforcement of environmental policies is weak.Global warming has the potential to decrease the suitable habitat available for mountain tapirs in the near future. If the temperature increases, the climatic conditions suitable for mountain tapir to occur will be shifting to higher altitudes, decreasing the capacity of the current protected areas to conserve mountain tapir habitat.   ",

        "Description": "Darwin’s Fox is endemic to Chile. The species occurs on a large extent of Chiloé Island and in Nahuelbuta National Park (Jiménez and MacMahon 2004). Surveys have revealed that the species is also present on private properties with well-preserved native forests outside of Nahuelbuta National Park. Until recently these were the only known populations for the species, with the exception of a skin found in Punta Chanchán, midway between Nahuelbuta and Chiloé (Vila et al. 2004). However, the recent finding of a Darwin’s Fox killed by a dog near Gorbea (D’Elia et al. 2013) and several records in three protected areas in the Valdivian Coastal Range (Farías et al. 2014) have confirmed a larger extent of occurrence than previously reported (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004). The presence of individuals has also been confirmed north of Llanquihue Lake, on the foothills of the Andes and approximately 60 km east to the coastal mountain range (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).",

        "threat": "Domestic dogs and associated diseases are likely the main threats for Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). Dogs are a common problem in Chilean protected areas, including each of those where the Darwin’s Fox is present. Domestic dogs would represent a risk for foxes through intra-guild killing, as well as through disease transmission (Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Cabello et al. 2013a,b). The death of Darwin’s Foxes due to dog attacks has been reported both on the mainland (D’Elia et al. 2013) and in Chiloé (Espinosa 2011, J. Jiménez pers. obs.). Moreira-Arce et al. (2015a) found a negative correlation between the areas used by dogs and foxes in Nahuelbuta. Accordingly, in Chiloé Island, Darwin’s Foxes are rare or absent from old-growth forests frequently visited by dogs, while they are frequently recorded at camera traps in scrublands when dogs are absent (A. Farías pers. obs.), suggesting spatial displacement. It is important to note that the dog problem that affects Darwin’s Foxes, is caused in most, if not all, cases by poorly managed free-ranging dogs and not feral dogs (D. Moreira pers. obs., E.A. Silva-Rodríguez et al. pers. obs.).The risk of disease spillover from dogs (mainly Canine Distemper Virus, CDV) is considered a major threat for Darwin’s Fox populations (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2015). Exposure of dogs to CDV has been shown in the proximity of Nahuelbuta National Park (Acosta-Jamett et al. 2015b) and Valdivian Coastal Reserve-Alerce Costero National Park (Sepúlveda et al. 2014). Furthermore, exposure to CDV has been reported for invasive American minks (Neovison vison) in areas were the Darwin’s Fox is present (Sepúlveda et al. 2014), as well as for Chilla (Lycalopex griseus) and Culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) in other regions (Acosta-Jamett et al. 2015a). Additionally, Jiménez et al. (2012) reported the death of three radio-collared foxes in Chiloé in sympatry with free-ranging dogs, suggesting that mortality could have been caused by CDV, although conclusive evidence was not available. CDV epizootics in canids have been reported worldwide (e.g., Goller et al. 2010, Di Sabatino et al. 2014), and CDV was implicated in a major decline in the population of the Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis) in Santa Catalina Island (Timm et al. 2009). In South America, Megid et al. (2009, 2010) reported CDV-related mortalities in wild canids in Brazil, and in Chile, Moreira and Stutzin (2005) reported the death of 27 Chilla and Culpeo foxes due to CDV in Coquimbo Region. The lack of conclusive evidence of declines due to CDV in the Darwin’s Fox may be well explained by lack of information, rather than by the absence of outbreaks.Darwin’s Foxes can also be subject to human-caused mortality. According to J. Jiménez (pers. obs.) and Espinosa (2011), local people in Chiloé reported killing foxes because they attack domestic animals and to obtain their fur. Foxes rescued from traps as well as captured and translocated after predation on poultry have also been reported in Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.). Stowhas (2012) also indicated that local people reported killing foxes (undetermined species) in an area that included the surroundings of Oncol Park, Alerce Costero National Park, and Valdivian Coastal Reserve, as a response to predation on poultry. In Nahuelbuta range, foxes (without distinguishing to the level of species) are often considered as problem animals (Sánchez et al. 2014). However, Darwin’s Fox is not commonly persecuted or killed by local people (but see McMahon et al. 1999) and its conservation would show a high social support (D. Moreira pers. obs.).Forest loss is an important threat. The highest rates of forest loss occur in the coastal range of the Araucanía Region, where Nahuelbuta is located. There, the annual loss rate observed for the 1999-2008 period reached 4.8%, the second highest reported for Chilean temperate forest (Miranda et al. 2015). For the Valdivian Coastal Range, the net forest loss between 1985 and 2011 was 5.1% (and the gross loss reached 30%), but the loss rate was higher for the 1985-1999 period than for the 1999-2011 period (Zamorano-Elgueta et al. 2015). In northern Chiloé and Maullín, the annual rates of forest loss was close to 1% (1985-2007), although in the case of Chiloé this rate rose to 1.4% for the 1999-2007 period (Echeverría et al. 2012). Both in the Araucanía and Valdivian cases, cleared native forest was frequently converted to forestry plantations (Miranda et al. 2015, Zamorano-Elgueta et al. 2015). Although Darwin’s Fox has been recorded in plantations (Farías et al. 2014, J. Jiménez pers. obs.), evidence from the population in Nahuelbuta shows that foxes select for native forest (Moreira-Arce et al. 2015a). However, if managed through an increase of native understory cover, commercial plantations may provide complementary habitats and food resources for this species (Moreira-Arce et al. 2015b). Human-induced fires are an always-latent threat, especially for the Nahuelbuta range (D. Moreira pers. obs.). On the other hand, deforestation may favour other (larger sized) fox species (i.e. Lycalopex griseus and L. culpaeus), better adapted to open areas (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2010), which can displace Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez et al. 1991). The indirect effects of changes in land cover through alteration of interaction webs are still insufficiently known.Indirect threats that need to be considered include the construction of bridges, highways and roads. Of major concern is the projected construction of the bridge connecting Chiloé to the mainland. This bridge, if barriers are not implemented, may facilitate the invasion of the island by other species such as congeneric foxes and Pumas (Puma concolor), with unknown, but potentially serious consequences for these populations. Road construction and improvement is an additional concern, given that they facilitate dog (Moreira-Arce et al. 2015a, Sepúlveda et al. 2015) and human movement, and can lead to land cover change (Wilson et al. 2005). Existing roads, as well as the construction of new roads and/or the improvement of existing public roads, is a concern for Nahuelbuta (Sánchez et al. 2014), the Valdivian Coastal Range (Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2015) and for Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.).Other threats that need to be taken into account include the translocation of rescued and problem animals (J. Cabello pers. obs.) and illegal tenure of foxes as pets (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).",

The primary threats to this species include native predators, ecosystem modification arising from post-logging forest succession, and longer term predicted habitat loss associated with climate change. Logging activities adjacent to colonies have created temporarily attractive habitat to marmots and have undoubtedly resulted in an increase in marmot populations. Bryant (1990), however, feared that logging clearcuts may be deleterious in the long run; there is evidence that, although they provide attractive summer habitat, they offer poor conditions for successful hibernation. They may thus act as \"sinks\" preventing dispersing marmots from reaching adjacent mountain ridges (Bryant 1996). This would decrease genetic outcrossing as well as preventing former colony sites from being recolonized. More research is needed. Bryant (1990) concluded that the known population of M. vancouverensis is not viable using existing criteria.Bryant and Page (2005) concluded that predation was the proximate cause of recent declines in wild Vancouver Island marmot populations, that losses were highly concentrated in late summer, and that previous studies exaggerated the importance of winter mortality. We suggest that high predation rates were associated with forestry and altered predator abundance and hunting patterns. Habitat loss due to natural cycles and clear cutting of forests as well as an increase in predation present threats to this species, and has caused existing populations to be unstable (Kruckenhauser et al. 2008).",

Disturbance from scientific study and recreational birdwatchers may cause stress and reduced lek attendance and production (BLM 1999, C. Braun in litt. 2005, J. R. Young in litt. 2005).

The only permanent structures remaining in the NWHI are US Fish and Wildlife Service facilities at Tern Island and Midway Atoll, and remnants of former Coast Guard facilities at Kure Atoll. Degradation of these structures, particularly at Tern Island, poses a significant entrapment hazard for Monk Seals. There are also concerns about legacy chemicals and contaminants that were left behind.Current threats to Monk Seals are thoroughly reviewed and analysed in National Marine Fisheries Service (2007). The most crucial threats in the NWHI at this time are: 1) food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators; 2) entanglement in marine debris, largely fragments of net and line discarded by North Pacific fisheries; 3) predation by sharks, especially on pre-weaned and recently weaned pups; and 4) intraspecific aggression by sub-dominant males. An emerging threat in this region may be the loss of terrestrial habitat due to sea level increases resulting from global warming (Baker et al. 2006). The situation in the MHI is different, with the main threats there being: 1) interactions with commercial and non-commercial fishing gear especially hookings and entanglements in gillnets; 2) possible transmission of diseases from feral animals, domestic pets, and livestock to seals; and 3) intentional killing and harassment.",

        "threat": "Habitat destruction and modification and the rapid spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the lowlands are thought to be responsible for past declines. The species may be particularly vulnerable to mosquito-borne diseases because it migrates altitudinally in response to varying `ohi`a flowering physiology, potentially increasing exposure to mosquitoes at lower elevations (USFWS 2003). From 1945 to 1995, the spread of feral pigs on Haleakala caused chronic habitat degradation (Loope and Medeiros 1995) and facilitated the spread of mosquitoes into remote rainforests (Pratt 1994). In Hanawi Natural Area Reserve, there was a 473% increase in pig activity, as indexed by ground-cover disturbance, during 1970-1997 (Rosa et al. 1998), and this reduced alternative food sources to `ohi`a bloom (Berlin and VanGelder 1999). Predation by introduced rats, cats, Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and possibly small Indian Mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) is a further limiting factor (Berlin and VanGelder 1999,  J. M. Scott in litt. 1999, J. C. Simon in litt. 1999,  E. VanGelder in litt. 1999). Climate change is an additional threat that may cause habitat shifts and extreme weather events.",

Avian pox and malaria probably cause mortality because introduced mosquitoes (vectors for these diseases) are now common at 900 m, and may breed at 1,200 -1, 400 m (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997, Lepson 1997, Lepson and Pratt 1997, Glad and Crampton 2015). There is concern that rising average temperatures could allow mosquitoes to survive at higher elevations and increase the exposure of birds to disease (Holmer 2007). A small increase in temperature is predicted to eliminate much of the mosquito-free zone on Kaua`i (U.S. Geological Survey per Holmer 2007) and a recent study has found evidence of this. Over the past two decades there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of avian malaria across the altitudinal range of the Alaka’i Plateau, which coincides with  increasing  air temperatures and changing patterns of precipitation and streamflow,  which in turn support increased transmission of the disease (Atkinson et al. 2014). During this time period, prevalence of malaria remained very low in the few ‘Akeke’e  individuals sampled, which may indicate high susceptibility to this disease (Atkinson et al. 2014). It is predicted that by 2100, there will be no “climatically-suitable” habitat left for this species on Kauai (Fortini et al. 2015). Food resources may be limited by alien wasps and ants which greatly reduce populations of native arthropods (Lepson and Pratt 1997). Introduced birds may also be competitors and introduced predators (particularly rats) probably cause some mortality (Lepson and Pratt 1997).  However, Hammond et al. (2015) observed no predation by rats on the eight nests they monitored, although two nests failed due to failure of the eggs to hatch. Adverse weather may be a significant limiting factor, e.g. prolonged, heavy rains which can result in nesting failure and cause massive mortality among fledglings and juveniles (Lepson and Pratt 1997). Two recent hurricanes resulted in serious damage to Kaua`i's forests (Pratt 1994). ‘Akeke’e appear to avoid, to some extent, areas that have suffered more hurricane damage, and thus have few, large trees; and areas that have been heavily invaded by weeds (Behnke et al. 2016).",

The several subpopulations are all reduced to a few to several mature trees, sometimes even a single tree, with little chance of natural generation due to changes in land use by a growing agrarian population. Secondary woodland in some narrow side valleys, where Metasequoia may occur along permanent streams, are under pressure of grazing and cutting of firewood. The mature, large trees have all been declared protected but habitat protection is overall inadequate (Bartholomew et al. 1983, Fu and Jin 1992), which means that the survival of this very interesting species in its natural habitat is not guaranteed.",

Habitat destruction is the major threat to this species in India (Medhi et al. 2004). Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi et al. 2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava et al. 2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and woodcutting have severely affected these forest reserves (Srivastava et al. 2001). Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.Molur et al. (2003) list the following threats for this species: “Crop plantations, grazing, harvesting non-woody vegetation for firewood and charcoal production, selective logging, timber collection, human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, trade, killed by domestic dogs, habitat loss, high juvenile mortality, inbreeding, and local trade in live animals as pets and in road shows. Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J. Das pers. comm.).",

        "threat": "This species faces a number of threats across its range. Disturbance, lead poisoning (from ammunition used in hunting game), direct and secondary poisoning, electrocution (by powerlines), collisions with wind turbines, reduced food availability and habitat change are currently impacting upon European populations (Donázar et al. 2002, N. Petkov in litt. 2005, Kurtev et al. 2008, Zuberogoitia et al. 2008, Carrete et al. 2009, Dzhamirzoev and Bukreev 2009, Sara et al. 2009, Angelov et al. 2013a, Mateo-Tomás and Olea 2015, Velevski et al. 2015, Donázar et al. 2016), with juveniles showing higher declines (Clouet et al. 2014) and mainland populations showing higher rates of juvenile mortality than island populations (Sanz-Aguilar et al. 2015a). Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain (Hernandez and Margalida 2009, Sanz-Aguillar et al. 2015b) and the Balkans (I. Angelov in. litt. 2012, Oppell et al. 2016). Declines in parts of Africa are likely to have been driven by loss of  wild ungulate populations and, in some areas, overgrazing by livestock and improvements in slaughterhouse sanitation (Mundy et al. 1992, Ogada et al. 2016). Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional \"muladares\" in Spain and Portugal (Donázar 2004, J. C. Atienza in litt. 2007, Donázar et al. 2009, Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2010, Donázar et al. 2010a, Cortés-Avizanda 2011, Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2016). However, recently passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers and guidelines about how to operate them exist (Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2010, A. Brunner in litt. 2010), and in eastern Europe dietary diversity has no effect on population sizes, but instead could affect territory size (Dobrev et al. 2016). Poisoning is a threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete et al. 2007, Carrete et al. 2009, Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2009, 2015 Sanz-Aguilar et al. 2015b, Oppel et al. 2016), and through the consumption of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries including Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted potential contamination of Egyptian Vultures that may lead to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease (e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria [Kurtev et al. 2008]). It appears that diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International news [www.birdlife.org/news] 2007), is driving the recent rapid declines in India (Cuthbert et al. 2006, A. Rahmani in litt. 2012, Galligan et al. 2014). NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects (BirdLife International news [www.birdlife.org/news] 2007). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by Gyps spp. vultures (Cuthbert et al. 2006). In 2007, diclofenac was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International news [www.birdlife.org/news] 2007). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden in litt. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International news [www.birdlife.org/news] 2007). This drug has recently been approved for veterinary use in Europe, and is commercially available in France and Spain, which is a major concern for the species (Margalida et al. 2014). Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donazar et al. 2002, Donazar et al. 2007a) and  potentially risky in other regions of Spain (Donazar et al. 2007b, 2010b) and in Africa (Nikolaus 1984, 2006), with 17 individuals found killed by electrocution in Port Sudan, over 10 days in  2010 (I. Angelov in litt. 2010, Angelov et al. 2013a), indicating a potentially serious problem that has persisted for decades and will continue to contribute to Egyptian Vulture population declines. In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W. Goodwin in litt. 2016). Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) may reduce breeding success in the short-term (Kurtev et al. 2008). ",

In 1988, forest cover was just 3% on Marinduque and 24% on Luzon. Forest cover in the Sierra Madre mountains has declined by 83% since the 1930s. Most remaining areas are under logging concession and may suffer further from major road-building plans. A road development near Subic Bay has increased the incidence of illegal logging and felling is rife at Maria Aurora Memorial Natural Park. Habitat modification may have accentuated interspecific competition, with the species having been replaced by Blue-crowned Racquet-tail P. discurus in Quezon National Park. It appears that the Green Racquet-tail might now only occur in two areas of   Luzon and that Subic Bay might be the only one with any protection (R.   Hutchison in litt. 2013). Even here, there are potential   threats to the habitat: in 2013 the Philippine military had reportedly   revived plans to build new air and naval bases at Subic Bay and to   reopen the base to United States forces.",

Any extensive patches of tall grass that might remain in Bangladesh are inundated for two-thirds of the year and are thus unlikely to support significant populations. Livestock grazing poses a threat throughout its range. An inappropriate fire regime coincides with the species's breeding season (A. Rahmani in litt. 2012); grass in the protected areas of Assam and northern W Bengal is burnt annually as part of management, potentially restricting available habitat for grassland specialist birds and increasing the risk of predation (A. Choudhury in litt. 2016). Its habit of running in tightly-knit groups when fleeing disturbance made it easy to kill several birds with a single shot, a factor likely to have contributed to its decline, in conjunction with a dramatic rise in hunting levels across its range (particularly in Bangladesh) during the 20th century. Its habitat at Mornoi, Assam, which was a major site of specimen collection in the past, has now been replaced by tea plantations (A. Choudhury in litt. 2012).  ",

        "threat": "A key threat is forest clearance and fragmentation, primarily as a result of demands for timber and agricultural land in an extremely densely populated region. Although the species can nest in human modified habitats, vulnerability of monocultures to pest invasion is a risk (Fellowes et al. 2001). Human disturbance may cause this secretive bird to abandon eggs while incubating (Li et al. 2007). Hunting is a major additional threat, even inside protected areas, and it may be particularly vulnerable when nesting. The decline or disappearance of the birds in Hubei and parts of Guangxi and Guangdong has been attributed to habitat damage and direct hunting (He Fenqi et al. 2007a). In Guangxi, the number of birds seen in markets outnumbers records in the wild. In recent years, a relatively high number of specimens have been collected, including those to supply scientific purposes, notably at Chebaling and Shennongjia (He Fenqi et al. 2007a). This, like capture for food, is illegal in China. Direct habitat damage for dam construction, river regulation and road building has driven birds from known sites, but counter-intuitively these activities also create new habitats in some cases. It appears that most areas of suitable habitat in Vietnam are subject to pressure from deforestation and hunting (Eames and Le Manh Hung 2009, Pilgrim et al. 2009, Walsh 2010), with overfishing and the intensive use of agricultural chemicals also being widespread (Pilgrim et al. 2009). The impact of chemical pesticides and fertilizers is unknown. Other threats affecting Ba Be National Park, Vietnam, include firewood collection, harvesting of non-timber forest products, occupation of agricultural land within the park, cattle-grazing, water pollution and sedimentation (Eames and Le Manh Hung 2009, Walsh 2010).  ",

        "threat": "Widespread accidental poisoning, largely due to strychnine, used by many farmers for predator control,  and more recently carbofuran, has contributed significantly to declines (Brown 1986, P. Hall in litt. 2000, Otieno et al. 2010, C. Kendall in litt. 2012). Several Lappet-faced Vultures were found to have died after feeding on the carcass of a poisoned jackal in Namibia (Komen 2009) and two birds were killed as a result of feeding on a poisoned carcass in Kenya (Kendall and Virani 2012). A mass poisoning event involving at least 15 Lappet-faced Vultures occurred in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom et al. 2012). The upper beaks of eight of these birds were removed suggesting that they may be traded for traditional medicine. It is also often mistakenly persecuted as a livestock predator (Brown 1986): one major deliberate poisoning incident killed 86 individuals in Namibia (Simmons 1995). Other major threats to the species include nest predation by humans, reduced food availability (including the replacement of the traditional \"Dabokka\" movement of camels with cargo tracks [H. Ibrahim in litt. 2016]) and electrocution (Shimelis et al. 2005). Increasing use of agricultural pesticides may also be a problem for the species (Mundy et al. 1992), including those breeding at Tayma, Saudi Arabia (Shimelis et al. 2005). Nest disturbance, to which it is extremely sensitive (Steyn 1982), may be growing with an increase in forest settlements in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis in litt. 2007) and the increasing recreational use of off-road vehicles (Mundy et al. 1992). In Saudi Arabia, suitable nesting trees may be subject to the most intense human disturbance as shepherds also use the same large trees for shelter for themselves and their livestock (Shobrak 2011). Breeding birds at Tayma could face disturbance from motorised vehicles in the desert (Shimelis et al. 2005). Nest trees are also susceptible to fire and are often pushed over by elephants (Murn and Botha in prep.).The population collapse in West Africa may be a result of higher nest disturbance, local extinctions of wild ungulates through habitat modification and over-hunting, intensified cattle farming in which sick or dying animals are rarely abandoned, and an increase in accidental poisoning (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Thiollay 2006), although the latter threat, in particular, requires further study (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). National vaccination campaigns in West Africa have reduced illness in domestic livestock, and sick animals can now be sold off, rather than abandoned, due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). The species may be hunted for medicine and cultural reasons in West Africa, and some ethnic groups in the sub-region hunt vultures for food, though the impact on this species is unknown (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). It is also thought to be used for traditional medicine in South Africa, with all vultures having the potential for traditional medicine use in southern Africa (McKean et al. 2013, W. Goodwin in litt. 2016) and has been recorded in trade in West and Central African markets (Buij et al. 2015). With 858-1,284 individuals reported to have been traded over a six year period in West Africa, numbers traded represent a potentially significant proportion of the regional population.In central Mozambique, the population has declined due to a scarcity of game and livestock following the armed conflict of the 1970s and 1980s, and the surviving population continues to be threatened by the over-exploitation of game by poachers (Parker 2005). There are incidences of deliberate poisoning by poachers, due to the belief that the arriving vultures will give away the locations of poached animals (Hancock 2009, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada et al. 2015). In Ethiopia, the principal threat to the species is habitat loss on the lowland plains (A. Shimelis in litt. 2007, 2012). Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species.",

        "threat": "Main threats to the Arabian Tahr include:Industrial and urban development activities are perhaps the biggest threat to tahr. The construction of roads, expansion of cities and industrial activities are destroying and fragmenting tahr habitat.In northern Oman an increase in mineral mining is a growing issue which is likely to threaten and damage valuable habitats, particularly in Al Batinah and Al Buraimi.The Hajar Mountains has a large and growing domestic goat Capra hircus population, estimated at 1.8 million in 2016. Domestic goats compete directly with Arabian Tahr for limited food resources, and larger numbers of goats at a site is related to the decline and expatriation of tahr (Ross et al. 2017).  Disease transmission from domestic goats to Arabian Tahr is a potential threat. Though there is little evidence of this happening, the large overlap in their habitat preferences means it is very likely.Despite legal protection, poaching of tahr does occur, as indicated by periodic prosecutions. The overall impact of poaching on the tahr population is difficult to quantify. The lack of enforcement of anti-poaching is also an issue.Habitat fragmentation is a major issue for the species, several populations are now isolated due to development of the surrounding landscape. The Jabal Hafeet tahr population and the southeastern tahr populations are most probably isolated from northwestern tahr populations.Lack of awareness amongst local people of the status of the Arabian Tahr (as an endemic and endangered species) results in decisions being made without due consideration of the impacts on the welfare and survival of this unique and regionally important species.Groundwater supplies in the Hajar Mountains are experiencing a sharp decline (Al-Charaabi and Al-Yahyai 2013), this will negatively affect perennial water pools on which the tahr depends.We expect climate change to have a major impact on the species due to an increase in extreme and average temperatures (Alsarmi and Washington 2011), decreases in rainfall (Al-Charaabi and Al-Yahyai 2013), and the resultant changes in habitat quality and composition. As the tahr’s distribution is limited to a single mountain range, and it already occurs in the upper elevations of this range, there is little scope for adaptation to climate change by dispersal or upward movement.  As most Arabian Tahr populations are simultaneously exposed to multiple threats, cumulative impacts are a major issue. The majority of tahr populations are concurrently exposed to habitat disturbance and fragmentation, competition and disease transmission from domestic goats, poaching and the effects of climate change. ",

        "threat": "Key threats are habitat loss, degradation and disturbance. Across the Indian subcontinent, and probably most of its range, wetlands have been drained or converted for agriculture and human settlements. The felling of large trees near wetlands has reduced the availability of nest and roost sites. The spread of water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes is a problem in India, as is the siltation of lakes due to catchment deforestation. Pollution of wetlands with pesticides and industrial effluents reduces breeding success. Habitat loss and degradation are compounded by disturbance of wetlands. Reductions in the prey base, primarily through hunting and over-fishing, are further consequences of increasing human pressure. In Myanmar, the development of oil and gas fields is a threat and, in China, hunting is a localised problem. In Mongolia, during surveys in summer 2009, it was noted that two recently completed hydroelectric dams were severely disrupting water levels in the affected drainage basins and could potentially affect all sites where the species occurs in the Great Lake Basin (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009). Over-fishing was also noted at several sites and low rainfall was leading to falling water levels in some areas (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009). Loss of mature trees following two major cyclones may have affected breeding sites in Odisha, India (M. Bhujabal in litt. 2017).",

Ongoing deforestation, both within and outside protected areas,  decreases the  amount of suitable habitat for the species; however, the  rate of forest  loss within its range over three generations (18 years) was estimated at  only 5%  (Tracewski et al. 2016). Therefore, deforestation is  assumed to  be only a minor contributor to the observed population  decline. The most  serious threat to the species stems from high levels of hunting, mostly via the use of snares. The species is hunted mainly for its meat, but also for the pet trade (McGowan and Kirwan 2018). Especially in the lowland forests throughout Vietnam and Laos, industrial snaring has been intensifying tremendously since the early 2000s (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2018). Given that throughout the species's range, there are no measures in place to reduce the amount of snaring (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2018), the population decline is very likely to go on, potentially even at an accelerating pace.The Malaysian population is assumed to be less threatened, with the main documented threat being low levels of habitat loss in the periphery of Taman Negara National Park. However, its narrow altitudinal range lies mostly outside protected areas, which exposes the species to disturbance from logging (D. Wells in litt. 2005). ",

        "threat": "Invasive mammals represent the largest threat to Barau’s Petrel. Cat predation is the most significant threat to the species with modelling indicating that the rate of predation is likely to be causing rapid population declines (Russell et al. 2009). Introduced rats are also a significant threat to the species, taking eggs and chicks and have been recorded at all visited breeding colonies (Pinet et al. 2009, M. LeCorre in litt. 2016). Goats and dogs are also present, however, these are thought to cause negligible declines.  Light pollution represents a significant threat due to the disorientation of juvenile birds and has been the target of Intensive conservation action. Light pollution is estimated to potentially lead to between 5 and 20% mortality dependent on weather and moon phase (M. LeCorre in litt. 2016); over 13,000 fledglings have been rescued since 1996 (M. LeCorre in litt. 2016). Widespread light pollution such as street lamps and sport installations are responsible for the vast majority of petrel light-induced mortality on Réunion (Le Corre et al. 2002).  Climate change may also affect the species in the future as a recent study based on a robust tracking dataset and habitat suitability modelling has shown that the wintering habitat may shift southward and may be reduced in size during the 21st century (Legrand et al. 2016).  Hunting is likely to have had a small effect on this species, causing rapid declines in a small portion of the population, but this threat is considered unlikely to return. ",

        "threat": "This species is primarily threatened by a reduction in reproductive success due to depredation of nests by invasive House Mice. On Gough Island, where 90% of the global population is found, chick failure was 87% in 2014-15, with chicks attacked by mice within 2 hours of hatching and dead within 3-7 hours (Dilley et al. 2015). On Tristan da Cunha, rats and mice are present and have likely contributed to the extirpation of the Atlantic Petrel from the island (Richardson 1984, Wanless et al. 2012), with human exploitation representing another potential driver of decline on this island (Richardson 1984). It is very unlikely to be exploited today (P. G. Ryan in litt. 1999, A. Bond in litt. 2016). The large population of native Southern Skua Stercorarius antarcticus feed on seabirds, including P. incerta (Richardson 1984); however, this is unlikely to be significant except in the situation that the population becomes greatly depleted.  Significant mortality of moulting adults, largely females, due to Hurricane Catarina indicates that increased storm intensity and frequency is likely to cause unpredictable adult mortality. Night strikes, as a result of being attracted to lights, are a further threat. This has been ameliorated at the Gough Island meteorological station, but may still pose a problem on ships at sea (Glass and Ryan 2013). It is, however, not thought to be causing significant declines in the population.",

Schomburgk’s Deer was prominent in the antlers sought by the Chinese medicine trade (Harper 1945).

        "threat": "This species faces a number of threats across its range. Disturbance, lead poisoning (from ammunition used in hunting game), direct and secondary poisoning, electrocution (by powerlines), collisions with wind turbines, reduced food availability and habitat change are currently impacting upon European populations (Donázar et al. 2002, N. Petkov in litt. 2005, Kurtev et al. 2008, Zuberogoitia et al. 2008, Carrete et al. 2009, Dzhamirzoev and Bukreev 2009, Sara et al. 2009, Angelov et al. 2013a, Mateo-Tomás and Olea 2015, Velevski et al. 2015, Donázar et al. 2016), with juveniles showing higher declines (Clouet et al. 2014) and mainland populations showing higher rates of juvenile mortality than island populations (Sanz-Aguilar et al. 2015a). Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain (Hernandez and Margalida 2009, Sanz-Aguillar et al. 2015b) and the Balkans (I. Angelov in. litt. 2012, Oppell et al. 2016). Declines in parts of Africa are likely to have been driven by loss of  wild ungulate populations and, in some areas, overgrazing by livestock and improvements in slaughterhouse sanitation (Mundy et al. 1992, Ogada et al. 2016). Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional \"muladares\" in Spain and Portugal (Donázar 2004, J. C. Atienza in litt. 2007, Donázar et al. 2009, Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2010, Donázar et al. 2010a, Cortés-Avizanda 2011, Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2016). However, recently passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers and guidelines about how to operate them exist (Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2010, A. Brunner in litt. 2010), and in eastern Europe dietary diversity has no effect on population sizes, but instead could affect territory size (Dobrev et al. 2016). Poisoning is a threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete et al. 2007, Carrete et al. 2009, Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2009, 2015 Sanz-Aguilar et al. 2015b, Oppel et al. 2016), and through the consumption of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries including Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted potential contamination of Egyptian Vultures that may lead to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease (e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria [Kurtev et al. 2008]). It appears that diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International news [www.birdlife.org/news] 2007), is driving the recent rapid declines in India (Cuthbert et al. 2006, A. Rahmani in litt. 2012, Galligan et al. 2014). NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects (BirdLife International news [www.birdlife.org/news] 2007). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by Gyps spp. vultures (Cuthbert et al. 2006). In 2007, diclofenac was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International news [www.birdlife.org/news] 2007). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden in litt. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International news [www.birdlife.org/news] 2007). This drug has recently been approved for veterinary use in Europe, and is commercially available in France and Spain, which is a major concern for the species (Margalida et al. 2014). Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donazar et al. 2002, Donazar et al. 2007a) and  potentially risky in other regions of Spain (Donazar et al. 2007b, 2010b) and in Africa (Nikolaus 1984, 2006), with 17 individuals found killed by electrocution in Port Sudan, over 10 days in  2010 (I. Angelov in litt. 2010, Angelov et al. 2013a), indicating a potentially serious problem that has persisted for decades and will continue to contribute to Egyptian Vulture population declines. In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W. Goodwin in litt. 2016). Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) may reduce breeding success in the short-term (Kurtev et al. 2008). ",
